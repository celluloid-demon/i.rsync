#!/bin/bash

# Exit on error, functions inherit parent scope for traps (-E same as `set -o errexit -o errtrace`)

set -eE

# Standard signal / pseudo-signal cheat sheet:

#   DEBUG:      This signal triggers right before a command is to be run.
#   ERR:        When a command ends in a non-zero status triggers this trap. Be aware that commands in if statements, loops, or strung-together commands may not trigger this signal.
#   EXIT:       The EXIT trap is used to specify actions that should be done before the script exits (zero as well as non-zero).
#   RETURN:     The RETURN signal is triggered after a function or sourced script exits.
#   SIGINT:     Interrupt from keyboard (ctrl + c)
#   SIGTERM:    Termination signal

# NOTE: You need single quotes to prevent $LINENO from being expanded when the trap line is first parsed.

# NOTE: Thanks to -E / -o errtrace, this still triggers the trap, even if a failure occurs *inside a function / loop*. With -e (but without -E), when a command fails inside a function, bash *instantly* exits, directly from the function scope - and since there is no ERR trap in effect there (because it wasn't inherited from the parent scope), your trap is not called.
